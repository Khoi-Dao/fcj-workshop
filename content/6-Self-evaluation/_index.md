During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** from **September 2025** to **November 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply cloud computing knowledge to a real-world AWS environment.  
I participated in the **AWS Cloud Journey internship program**, where I completed a comprehensive 12-week learning journey and deployed a production-ready web application architecture on AWS. Through this project, I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, AWS services, Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation), CI/CD pipelines, monitoring and observability, security best practices, and problem-solving in cloud environments**.

The main project involved designing and implementing a complete AWS web application architecture including:

- **Edge Layer**: Route 53, CloudFront CDN, AWS WAF, ACM Certificate, S3 static hosting
- **Networking**: VPC, subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Security Groups, VPC Flow Logs
- **Compute & Database**: EC2 with Auto Scaling, RDS, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito
- **CI/CD**: GitLab, CodePipeline, CodeBuild with automated deployments
- **Monitoring & Security**: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, SNS alerts, IAM, Secrets Manager 

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Strengths

* **Ability to learn**: I find that I can learn and easily understand AWS services and concepts. When encountering something I am not sure of, I determine to search and find answer till I am satisfied  
* **discipline**:  I read and respectfully follow company rules and regulation.
* **Progressive mindset**: I am not be demotivated by any kind of criticism. instead, I will reflect what I do wrong, and strive to improve better and not to repeat the same mistake
* **Professional Conduct**: I respect everyone in the company, including my fellow interns and attend work seriously

### Needs Improvement

* **Professional knowledge & skills**: Due to the lack of time management, I wasn't able to absorb knowledge fully and deeply. 
* **Time Management and Discipline**: While I completed  tasks, I greetly struggled with time management when dealing with balancing life and work. I need to improve my ability to manage,schedule and priortize what must be done first and urgently.
* **Communication**: I am fully aware of how passive I am when it comes to communication. I am still struggle to proactively with my teammates and people around me
* **Cost Optimization Awareness**: I focused more on functionality than cost optimization because it was so exciting to explore AWS services. I should consider cost implications
*  **Contribution to project/team**: due to my Incompetence in communication. I found myself not contriubting much to the team and project. I am ashamed of myself

### Reflection

This internship provided invaluable hands-on experience with AWS cloud services and best practices. It has strengthened my problem-solving skills and technical knowledge. Broaden my mind just how difficult work is, in which I believe it is but just a small fraction of what to come in future


I am grateful for the opportunity to work in AWS intership program and look forward to applying skills I have learnt in future cloud architecture and DevOps roles.
