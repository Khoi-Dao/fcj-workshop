# Full-Stack Web Application Deployment on AWS

#### Overview

This workshop demonstrates how to deploy a complete **full-stack web application** on AWS using **Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)**. You will learn to build a production-ready architecture with:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot REST API on EC2 with Auto Scaling
- **Frontend**: React application served via CloudFront from S3
- **Database**: MySQL RDS for data persistence
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API with CORS support
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer for high availability
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connectivity to AWS services (S3, SSM, CloudWatch)

#### Architecture Highlights

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Entire infrastructure defined in CloudFormation templates
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with Auto Scaling Groups
- **Security**: Private subnets, security groups, IAM roles, VPC endpoints
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs, alarms, and metrics
- **Cost Optimization**: VPC endpoints to reduce NAT Gateway data transfer costs
- **Scalability**: Auto Scaling based on CPU metrics
