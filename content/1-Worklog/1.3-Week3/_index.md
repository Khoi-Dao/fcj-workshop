### Week 3 Objectives:

* Build a Strong foundation of Amazon EC2 and its ecosystem  (AMI, Backup, Key Pair, EBS, Instance Store, User Data, Metadata) knowledge.
* Learn about EC2 Auto Scaling and its role in elasticity and cost optimization.
* Search and experience related compute services including EFS, FSx, Lightsail, and AWS MGN.
* Reinforce AWS storage knowledge with practicing labs covering S3, AWS Backup, and Storage Gateway.
* Reinforce practical skills in configuring, managing, and scaling EC2 workloads.

### Week 3 Achievements:

* Made a solid theoretical knowledge foundation of Amazon EC2, including:

  * AMI and backup strategies for resilience.
  * Key Pair usage for secure SSH authentication.
  * Differences between EBS (persistent storage) and Instance Store (ephemeral storage).
  * How User Data and Metadata scripts automate instance initialization and provide dynamic configuration.
  * The role of EC2 Auto Scaling in maintaining performance and cost efficiency.

* Learnt the related services:

  * Amazon EFS and FSx for shared and high-performance file storage.
  * Amazon Lightsail as a simplified alternative for small-scale workloads.
  * AWS MGN for migrating workloads into AWS.

* Completed practical labs:

  * Launched and managed an S3 bucket (Lab57).
  * Implemented AWS Backup to protect workloads (Lab13).
  * Integrated on-premises systems with AWS using Storage Gateway (Lab24).

* Key skills acquired:

  * Confidently distinguish storage types (EBS vs Instance Store vs EFS vs FSx).
  * Automate EC2 lifecycle with User Data and Auto Scaling.
  * Combine backup and hybrid storage solutions to create more resilient architectures.
