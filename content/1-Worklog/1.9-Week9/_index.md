### Week 9 Objectives:

* Build **VPC and Networking Core**: Create VPC with public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway.
* Establish secure network boundaries with proper routing and subnet segmentation.
* Configure **Security Groups** for EC2, RDS, and ALB following least-privilege principles.
* Set up **IAM roles and policies** for EC2 instances with custom permissions.
* Enable **VPC Flow Logs** for network traffic monitoring and auditing.


### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2 | - **VPC Creation & Subnet Configuration:** <br> + Create VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 in selected AWS region. <br> + Create public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) in one Availability Zone with appropriate tags. <br> + Create private subnet (10.0.2.0/24) in the same Availability Zone with appropriate tags. <br> + Apply consistent tagging strategy (Name, Environment, Project, etc.) to all resources. <br> + Document subnet allocation and IP addressing scheme. | 02/11/2025 | 02/11/2025 | AWS VPC documentation |
| 3 | - **Internet Gateway Setup:** <br> + Create and attach Internet Gateway to VPC. <br> + Configure public subnet route table to route internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to Internet Gateway. <br> + Verify public subnet route table configuration. <br> + Test internet connectivity from public subnet (launch test EC2 instance if needed). <br> + Document routing configuration and gateway associations. | 03/11/2025 | 03/11/2025 | Internet Gateway guide |
| 4 | - **NAT Gateway Configuration:** <br> + Allocate Elastic IP address for NAT Gateway. <br> + Create NAT Gateway in public subnet (10.0.1.0/24). <br> + Configure private subnet route table to route internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through NAT Gateway. <br> + Verify private subnet route table configuration. <br> + Test outbound internet connectivity from private subnet (launch test EC2 instance in private subnet). <br> + Verify private subnet instances can reach internet while remaining isolated from inbound connections. | 04/11/2025 | 04/11/2025 | NAT Gateway documentation |
| 5 | - **Security Groups Design & Implementation:** <br> + Create Security Group for EC2 instances: allow inbound from API Gateway/ALB, outbound to RDS and internet via NAT. <br> + Create Security Group for RDS: allow inbound only from EC2 Security Group on database port (3306/5432). <br> + Create Security Group for ALB (if used): allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS from internet, outbound to EC2 Security Group. <br> + Apply least-privilege principle: grant minimum necessary permissions. <br> + Document security group rules and relationships. | 05/11/2025 | 05/11/2025 | Security Groups guide |
| 6 | - **IAM Roles & Policies for EC2:** <br> + Create IAM role for EC2 instances with descriptive name. <br> + Create custom IAM policy for EC2 to access required AWS services (S3, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, etc.). <br> + Attach IAM role to EC2 instance profile. <br> + Test IAM role permissions from EC2 instance (use AWS CLI or SDK). <br> + Verify EC2 can access Secrets Manager to retrieve database credentials. <br> + Document IAM roles and their permissions. | 06/11/2025 | 06/11/2025 | IAM best practices |
| 7 | - **Network ACLs & VPC Flow Logs:** <br> + Review and configure Network ACLs (optional, default ACLs are usually sufficient). <br> + Test Network ACL rules if custom rules are implemented. <br> + Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture IP traffic flow information. <br> + Configure Flow Logs destination (CloudWatch Logs or S3 bucket). <br> + Review Flow Logs to audit network traffic patterns. <br> + Audit and document all network configurations for security review. <br> - **Week 9 Summary:** VPC and networking core complete, ready for backend and database deployment in Week 10. | 07/11/2025 | 07/11/2025 | VPC Flow Logs documentation |


### Week 9 Achievements:

*  Successfully created **VPC and subnet infrastructure**:

  * Created VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 in selected AWS region.
  * Configured public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) for internet*facing resources with proper tagging.
  * Configured private subnet (10.0.2.0/24) for application servers with proper tagging.
  * Applied consistent tagging strategy across all network resources for better management.

* Set up **Internet Gateway** for public subnet connectivity:

  * Created and attached Internet Gateway to VPC.
  * Configured public subnet route table to route internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to Internet Gateway.
  * Verified public subnet instances can access internet directly.
  * Documented routing configuration and gateway associations.

* Configured **NAT Gateway** for private subnet outbound access:

  * Allocated Elastic IP address and created NAT Gateway in public subnet.
  * Configured private subnet route table to route internet traffic through NAT Gateway.
  * Verified private subnet instances can reach internet for outbound connections (updates, downloads, API calls).
  * Confirmed private subnet remains isolated from inbound internet connections (security best practice).

* Implemented **Security Groups** following least*privilege principles:

  * Created Security Group for EC2: allows inbound from API Gateway/ALB, outbound to RDS and internet.
  * Created Security Group for RDS: allows inbound only from EC2 Security Group on database port.
  * Created Security Group for ALB (if used): allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS, outbound to EC2.
  * Applied least-privilege principle: granted minimum necessary permissions for each component.
  * Documented security group rules and relationships for maintainability.

* Configured **IAM roles and policies** for EC2:

  * Created IAM role for EC2 instances with descriptive naming.
  * Created custom IAM policy for EC2 to access required AWS services (S3, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch).
  * Attached IAM role to EC2 instance profile.
  * Tested IAM permissions from EC2 instance and verified access to Secrets Manager.
  * Documented IAM roles and permissions for security audit.

* Enabled **VPC Flow Logs** for network monitoring:

  * Enabled VPC Flow Logs to capture IP traffic flow information.
  * Configured Flow Logs destination (CloudWatch Logs or S3 bucket).
  * Reviewed Flow Logs to audit network traffic patterns and identify anomalies.
  * Audited all network configurations for security compliance.
