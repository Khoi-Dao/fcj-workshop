### Week 5 Achievements:

* Understanding and Applying the AWS Shared Responsibility Model

  * Understood that AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, while users are responsible for securing their own data and applications.
  * Clarified the role in ensuring compliance and protection when deploying services on AWS.

* Theoretical Knowledge of AWS Core Security Services

  * Amazon IAM: Learned how to create and manage Users, Roles, and Policies to control user and group access.
  * Amazon Cognito: Studied user management and authentication for AWS applications.
  * AWS Identity Center: Understood how to link and manage user access across multiple AWS services.
  * AWS Security Hub: Configured and utilized it to monitor and detect security threats.
  * AWS KMS: Practiced encrypting data at rest and securing sensitive data using encryption keys.

* Practical Implementation of AWS Security Services

  * Successfully installed and configured AWS Security Hub for continuous monitoring and vulnerability detection.
  * Configured IAM Permissions Boundaries to restrict user privileges and prevent unauthorized access.
  * EC2 Cost Optimization with Lambda: Automated the shutdown of unused EC2 instances to minimize operational costs.
  * EC2 Access Control via IAM & Resource Tags: Applied IAM Policies that use Tags to precisely define access scope.
* Enhanced AWS Resource Management Skills

  * Created and managed IAM Groups and Policies, improving group-based access control.
  * Learned how to manage multiple AWS accounts using AWS Organizations, ensuring consistent security policies across the organization.
