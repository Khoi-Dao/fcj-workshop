### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 15, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Outcomes or Value Gained:**

- **Lessons Learned**: I learned about the complete AWS AI/ML ecosystem, from Amazon SageMaker for traditional ML to Amazon Bedrock for Generative AI. I gained deep understanding of prompt engineering techniques like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Few-shot learning. I also learned about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture and how it's crucial for building accurate GenAI applications. The importance of guardrails for AI safety and content filtering in production applications was also emphasized.
- **New Skills**: I developed skills in using Amazon SageMaker Studio for ML model development and deployment. I learned how to implement RAG architecture for knowledge base integration. I gained practical knowledge of prompt engineering and how to build Bedrock Agents for multi-step workflows. I also learned about different foundation models (Claude, Llama, Titan) and when to use each one.
- **Contribution to Team/Project**: I shared comprehensive notes about SageMaker capabilities and Bedrock features with my team. I identified opportunities to implement RAG solutions for our domain-specific applications. I proposed pilot projects using Bedrock Agents for customer service automation. I also created guidelines for prompt engineering best practices and guardrail implementation for our GenAI projects.

### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** DevOps on AWS

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 17, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Đ. Hải Triều, Bến Nghé, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Outcomes or Value Gained:**

- **Lessons Learned**: I learned about DevOps culture and principles, including DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, MTTR, Change Failure Rate) for measuring DevOps maturity. I gained deep understanding of AWS CI/CD services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) and different deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling). I also learned about Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation and CDK, and when to use each approach.
- **New Skills**: I developed skills in building complete CI/CD pipelines using AWS DevOps services. I learned how to implement Infrastructure as Code with both CloudFormation and CDK. I gained practical knowledge of container services (ECR, ECS, EKS, App Runner) and when to use each one. I also learned how to set up monitoring and observability using CloudWatch and X-Ray.
- **Contribution to Team/Project**: I shared comprehensive notes about AWS DevOps services and best practices with my team. I proposed implementing CI/CD pipelines using CodePipeline for automated deployments. I suggested adopting Infrastructure as Code for all our infrastructure using CloudFormation or CDK. I also created guidelines for containerization strategies and monitoring best practices. The knowledge gained helps our team implement modern DevOps practices and improve deployment frequency and reliability.

### [Event 3](4.3-Event3/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 29, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Đ. Hải Triều, Bến Nghé, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Outcomes or Value Gained:**

- **Lessons Learned**: I learned about the AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar and its five core pillars: Identity & Access Management, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, and Incident Response. I gained deep understanding of core security principles including Least Privilege, Zero Trust, and Defense in Depth. I also learned about the Shared Responsibility Model and top security threats in cloud environments in Vietnam. The importance of building security into architecture from the start, not as an afterthought, was emphasized.
- **New Skills**: I developed skills in modern IAM architecture using IAM Identity Center, Service Control Policies, and permission boundaries. I learned how to implement comprehensive detection and monitoring using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub. I gained practical knowledge of network security with VPC segmentation, Security Groups, NACLs, WAF, and Shield. I also learned about encryption at rest and in transit, KMS key management, and secrets management with Secrets Manager and Parameter Store.
- **Contribution to Team/Project**: I shared comprehensive security best practices and the five pillars framework with my team. I proposed implementing modern IAM patterns with IAM Identity Center for SSO. I suggested setting up comprehensive monitoring using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub. I created incident response playbooks for common scenarios like compromised IAM keys, S3 public exposure, and EC2 malware detection. I also developed guidelines for encryption strategies and secrets management. The knowledge gained helps our team build secure cloud architectures following AWS Well-Architected best practices.
